# Documentation map

Use this page to find the authoritative document for a task. Current shipped
behavior and accepted ADRs govern existing APIs. Historical plans and research
are evidence, not shipped contracts, when a later ADR supersedes them.

## Shipped contracts

- [`../README.md`](../README.md) — installation, public tools, configuration,
  lifecycle, and role authoring.
- [`../CONTEXT.md`](../CONTEXT.md) — orchestration glossary.
- [`../skills/orchestrate/SKILL.md`](../skills/orchestrate/SKILL.md) — public
  subagent review fan-out and parent synthesis procedure.
- [`../skills/orchestrate/adversarial-review.md`](../skills/orchestrate/adversarial-review.md)
  — adversarial topology, finding records, and incomplete-coverage policy.
- [`worktree-subagents.md`](worktree-subagents.md) — worktree operation,
  review, recovery, and cleanup.

The package launches asynchronous Pi children in Herdr and supports managed
worktrees for writing tasks. Orchestrated review materializes pinned evidence,
launches fresh public reviewers, receives automatic completion delivery, and
has the parent synthesize outcomes. Role frontmatter tool allowlists are the
available enforcement boundary; `read,bash` is not read-only. Automated package
acceptance covers unit tests, lint, and `npm pack --dry-run`. Deterministic
Herdr integration is a manual release gate run from inside Herdr. The manual
supervision transport benchmark is `../test/bench/supervision-bench.mjs`; it
uses an isolated Herdr server and writes uncommitted raw samples to
`/tmp/issue29-bench/`.

## ADRs

| ADR | Status | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`0001`](adr/0001-btw-ephemeral-side-questions.md) | Accepted | Add `/btw` as an ephemeral side-question child. |
| [`0002`](adr/0002-agent-workflow-skill-runtime-taxonomy.md) | Partially superseded by 0009 | Keep agent execution, skills, and Pi runtimes distinct. |
| [`0003`](adr/0003-installable-role-packs.md) | Accepted | Define installable role-pack discovery and collision rules. |
| [`0004`](adr/0004-require-active-user-approval-for-workflow-execution.md) | Superseded by 0009 | Historical exact-script approval decision. |
| [`0005`](adr/0005-parent-owns-workflow-script-authority.md) | Superseded by 0009 | Historical workflow-script authority decision. |
| [`0006`](adr/0006-limit-v1-execution-effects-to-isolated-worktrees.md) | Partially superseded by 0009 | Historical runner effect boundary; managed worktree rules remain. |
| [`0007`](adr/0007-require-fresh-review-for-workflow-scripts.md) | Superseded by 0009 | Historical workflow-review decision. |
| [`0008`](adr/0008-adopt-pi-only-subagent-execution.md) | Partially superseded by 0012 | Remove the legacy external CLI adapter; Pi remains the default execution path. |
| [`0009`](adr/0009-remove-workflow-subsystem.md) | Accepted | Remove the workflow subsystem; use public subagent fan-out and parent synthesis. |
| [`0010`](adr/0010-persistent-specialists-as-session-generations.md) | Accepted | Define persistent specialists as logical identities with policy-bound session generations. |
| [`0011`](adr/0011-explicit-worktree-cleanup.md) | Accepted | Authorize explicit worktree cleanup by cwd containment; retain branches and reject automatic reaping. |
| [`0012`](adr/0012-native-claude-kiro-harness.md) | Accepted | Add first-stage native Claude Code and Kiro harnesses behind a small execution seam; partially supersedes 0008. |

## Historical material

- [`orchestrated-review-workflow-plan.md`](orchestrated-review-workflow-plan.md)
  — superseded workflow design, retained as history.
- [`research/`](research/) — background evidence and alternatives, not shipped
  behavior.
