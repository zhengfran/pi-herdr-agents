		"Initialize task-model routing using the structured registry object below, captured from the active session after extensions loaded. It includes every available exact provider/id, not the truncated rendered catalog. Do not crawl auth.json, models-store.json, or reconstruct a fresh SDK registry.",
		`Complete registry brief: ${brief.models.length} models, ${json.length} JSON characters (not a token estimate). Compact JSON reduces formatting overhead, but large catalogs still consume context; no models are truncated. This is the current synchronous snapshot: a dynamic provider whose initial catalog refresh has not completed might be absent. No provider refresh or network probes are performed.`,
		"Availability means configured authentication, not proof of account access or a successful network request. Do not make live model calls to test access. Extension registration and auth-source metadata are included only when the active API exposes them; omitted metadata is unknown. Do not infer subscription status from OAuth or free usage from reported zero costs. Costs are registry-reported per-million-token base rates, not measured billing; absent values are unknown, distinct from reported zero.",
		"Treat operatorPreferences as the operator's ranking preferences. Unless they specify otherwise, apply capability-first ranking for substantive implementation, review, architecture, and documentation; prefer efficiency for bounded reconnaissance and test execution. Task categories describe kinds of work, not complexity tiers. Choose supported thinking separately for the actual task; a cheap model or large context window alone does not establish quality.",
		"Research the major candidates across providers with available web search, prioritizing primary sources for current task fit. Compare capabilities, limitations, and trade-offs, distinguish vendor claims from independent or local evidence, cite sources, and disclose uncertainty. Do not assume familiar providers win. If search is unavailable or yields no usable evidence, use registry-only and clearly describe ranking uncertainty; use research only when usable sources actually inform the ranking.",
		"Draft all six categories defined in categories, using only exact authenticated refs in models. Review current saved tasks, metadata, default, and agent preferences before changing anything; do not silently discard existing choices. Explain replacements and omissions. Avoid multiple routes to the same upstream model within a category unless deliberate availability redundancy is useful and explained; display names can help identify upstream candidates, but names and aliases are not proof of equivalence; verify with research.",
		"Review shortlists prioritize family diversity and other-family candidates when available, but do not enforce independence. Cross-family independent review requires a reviewer from a different model family than the author. A different provider serving the same upstream family is not independent review; project policy may separately require a different provider. For ordinary review, prefer a different authenticated model family. When no other authenticated model family is available, ordinary review may use a same-family reviewer in a fresh standalone session. Disclose that this review is context-isolated, not cross-family independent. Cross-family verification, `/skill:review`, and `adversarial-reviewer` must not use this fallback. They cannot treat a shortlist as proof of independence.",
		"task:<category> aliases are subagent model selectors, not commands or parent model changes. Use them only as the whole subagent tool model argument. Ordered authenticated candidate plans resolve before launch (launch-time selection). Ordinary nonpersistent runs can try later candidates after launch failure or after a running child settles with a provider/agent error, not after a completed negative task result. Persistent specialists do not advance after a running-child error. This is not dynamic per-step routing. Worktree runs use the first authenticated candidate only, with no fallback retries.",
		"Task model preferences do not enable or authorize automatic input routing. /subagents-init and subagents_write_task_models must preserve unrelated autoRouting settings without granting egress consent, approving role/harness/model/effort tuples, or changing its mode. The writer rejects duplicate JSON members inside autoRouting, including a repeated top-level section, in the current file or example source before any write; do not repair ambiguous approval JSON. Do not treat task shortlists as automatic-routing permissions; that separate operator workflow is documented in README.md#automatic-input-routing.",
		"If there are no available models, do not write configuration; report the availability limitation. Otherwise call subagents_write_task_models with the reviewed draft and tasksMeta containing current UTC generatedAt and method (research or registry-only). The tool atomically replaces tasks and tasksMeta, preserves unrelated settings, and accepts partial nonempty categories; explain any missing categories rather than inventing candidates.",
		"Base the final category-to-candidates table and before/after summary on the normalized saved tasks, tasksMeta, configPath, and missingCategories returned by the tool, not the unsaved draft. Disclose the applied ranking policy, notable exclusions, sources and whether research informed the ranking, uncertainty, and changes to existing choices. Instruct the user to run /reload (or start a new session) before task:<category> routing and guidance update.",
